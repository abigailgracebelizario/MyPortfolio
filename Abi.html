<h1>Hello! My name is Abi!</h1>
<p>I enjoy writing my own books. Right now I am working on a book called Glenlake Academy.</p>
<img src="books-3.jpg" alt="Books" height="200" width="200">
<p>Glenlake Academy is about a group of friends who are in eighth grade that go to boarding school.</p> 
<p> Andre finds himself in a lot of trouble with the principal of the school because he's dating her nephew, which she doesn't approve of at all.</p>
<p> Relationships are in hot water and the tension between them is building up. </p> 
<p> His death rattles his friends and the entire school. Can his friends or the police find out who the killer is before they get away with murder? </p>
